> # object  --> the value to be printed is object
  # sep--> seperator
  # Eg
  # a = 8
  # b = 9
  # c = 89
  # print(a,b,c sep='$' )
  
  # end --> which is used to add the string at the end of the value'
  # # it will not keep the command to stay in same line
  # print(str(a), b, end = '%%')
  #print(str(c))

  # ! ----> variables
  # ?variable is a name which is used to identify the value of variable
  # ?which is stored in a specific memory location

  #!Rules to define variables
  #1.) variables have to start with only alphabets, underscores
  #2.) the char following 1st char can be alphabets, number, underscores
  #3.) no spaces are allowed
  #4.) no special characters like !@#$%^&*()+
  #5.) case sensitive
  #6.) keywords are not allowed as variables

  # ! ways to define variables

  # a = 8
  # b = 9
  # print(a,b)

  # a = 7, b = 9 # error
  # print(a)
  # print(b)

  # a = 7
  # b = 7

  # a = b =7
  # orint(a,b)

 #a= 7,9,89, "hello"
 #print(a)
 #print(type(a))
